Used for simple string output.\\n\\n- String concatenation with + - Combines strings, numbers, variables into a single output string. \\n\\n- System.out.print() - Prints text without moving to a new line. Used with \\\\n for line breaks.\\n\\n- Escape sequences \\\\n and \\\\t - New line and tab characters.\\n\\n- System.out.printf() - Formatted print similar to C printf. Uses format specifiers like %s, %d to insert variables. More readable than concatenation. \\n\\n- Variable declaration and assignment - Defines string, int, double variables and assigns values.\\n\\n- Variable usage in print statements - Outputs the values of variables as part of strings.\\n\\n- Demonstrates different ways to combine hardcoded strings with variables for output - Using +, printf format specifiers, direct concatenation.\\n\\nSo in summary, it shows the basic methods for printing output in Java and how to incorporate variables into printed strings.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/chap01/Helloworld.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file contains a simple \\\&quot;Hello World\\\&quot; program.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a package name of \\\&quot;chap01\\\&quot; - This organizes the code into a package\\n\\n- Declares a public class called \\\&quot;Helloworld\\\&quot; - This is the main class for the program\\n\\n- Contains a main method declared as public static void - This is the entry point for the program \\n\\n- The main method prints the string \\\&quot;Hello World\\\&quot; to the console using System.out.println\\n\\n- No other methods are defined, it is a simple one method program\\n\\n- Complies and runs as a basic Java application to display \\\&quot;Hello World\\\&quot; when executed\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a package \\n- Declares a main class\\n- Contains a main method as the program entry point\\n- Prints a simple message to the console\\n- Acts as a basic \\\&quot;Hello World\\\&quot; Java program to demonstrate a simple compile and run cycle.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
